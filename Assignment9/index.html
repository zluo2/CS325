I hope my players can feel exciting and interesting when they are playing my game.
</li>
<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
This game is very easy, you just need to use your mouse to control motor to get high score and avoid car accident.
</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Racing.
</li>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>

</li>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Good luck
</li>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>
No having fun
</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Someone who like motor racing.
</li>
<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
3-5 mins
</li>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
 I think the main way to play my game is saving more time possibility. Because the game only has five mins, the player need to finish the game (arriving the destination) before the time up. Mainly, some events would reduce your time. Therefore, the player needs to calculate how to use their limit time effectively

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I realize that how to change the physical prototype to digital prototype is very hard. Because I make the physical prototype is too difficult, and it is a little bit hard to become a digital prototype, I try to simplify my physical prototype. For example, I reduce some game special events. 
I think the main problem for me to do this game is that I am not really good at javascript. I have tried my best to change my physcial prototype to digital prototype, but something I don't know how to do it. 
Therefore, I make this game like a racing game without time limit. You just need to keep safe and get the stars.
